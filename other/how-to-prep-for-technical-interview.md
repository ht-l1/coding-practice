#### 2. Resumes
- one page, easy to skim
- contact info (phone#, professional email, Linkedin, GitHub, portfolio)
- highlight specific accomplishments
- include interesting personal projects
- no objective, no charts/ratings, don't sweat aesthetics

---

#### 3. Before the Interview
```
Process (contain but might not all)
- online coding challenge
- take home
- technical phone screen (convo with engineers about coding problem)
- onsite 
```

```
Types of Interviews
- Algorithms & Coding
- System Design
- Practical
- Deep Dive
- Values
```

```
Expectations of You
- think through a problem (your thought process)
- write functional code 
- fix issues (along the way, and adapt the code based on interviewer feedback)
- reason about runtime
- communicate clearly (communicate your solution)
```

<b>Prepare for Interviews</b> <br>
```
Algorithms & Coding
- practice! 
- choose a language and stick to it
- learn syntax/builtins, error handling
```

```
know how to:
- create a function
- define a class
- work with strings
- work with lists
- work with trees
```

```
some common runtime:
- constant
- logarithmic
- linear
- polynomial
- exponential
```

<b>Build your toolbox</b> <br>
``` 
Core Concepts:
- recursion, Divide-and-Conquer
- Graph Searches
- Greedy Algorithms
- Strings
- Searching & Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
```

```
Tools you have at your disposal:
- Arrays, linked lists
- Hash tables
- Binary search
- Shortest-path algorithms
- Memorization
```

```
Simulate the Environment
- Use a pen and paper
- Time yourself, no cheating
- Look for patterns
- Practice with friends
```

#### 4. During the Interview
<i><b>Process!</b> not output</i>

The Icebreaker

Approaching Technical Problems

Strategy

Writing Code

Testing Code without Running
