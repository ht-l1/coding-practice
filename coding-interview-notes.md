## Cracking the Coding Interview

### Technical Questions

***How to prepare***
1. try to solve the proble on your own (think about the space and time efficiency)
2. write the code on paper 
3. test your code - on paper
	general cases, base bases, error cases
	you'll need to do this during interview anyways
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer 
	expect errors but learn more it
5. do as many mock interviews as possible

***Walking Through a Problem*** <br>
[A Problem-Solving Flowchart](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf)

What to Expect
1. Listen Carefully
2. Draw an Example (whiteboard it)
    - specific - real numbers or strings
    - sufficiently large 
    - not a special case
3. State a Brute Force
    ok that this initial solution is bad. Explain what the space and time complexity is, and then dive into improvements. 
4. Optimize
    - look for any unused info (for example was it sorted?)
    - use a fresh example (can give you fresh ideas and help you see patterns)
    - solve it "incorrectly" 
    - make time vs space tradeoff
    - precompute info
    - use a hash table (should be at the top of your mind)
    - think about the best conceivable runtime
5. Walk Through (structure)
6. Implement (modualrized code, error checks (add todo))
7. Test (before submitting)
    - start with a "conceptual" test
    read and analyze each line of code
    - weird looking code
    - hot spots
    - small test cases
    - special cases
