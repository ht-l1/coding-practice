#### Arrays
- Ordered collections of values
- Arrays are indexed
- Array methods
    - `push` > add to end
    - `pop` > remove from end
    - `shift` > remove from start
    - `unshift` > add to start
- Nested Arrays

#### Object Literals
- Objects are collections of properties
- <b>Properties are a key-value pair</b>
- rather than accessing data using an index, we use custom keys
- valid keys - all keys are converted to strings
- `dot notation` vs `bracket notation`
    - `dot notation` is faster to write and clearer to read
    - `bracket notation` allows special characters and selection of properties using variables

#### While Loops 
continue running as long as the test condition is true
